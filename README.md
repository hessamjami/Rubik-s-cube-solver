# Rubik-s-cube-solver
Solving a Rubik's Cube with code typically involves implementing a predefined algorithm. Many modern solutions use heuristic approaches like the Kociemba's Algorithm, which reduces the cube to a simpler state and then solves it completely. Below is a Python script leveraging the kociemba library, a popular tool for solving the Rubik's Cube.
